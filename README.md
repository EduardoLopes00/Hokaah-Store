# Hokaah Store

This is a project to simulate a hokaah store control system.

More than pratice the auth using JWT, I want to use this project to learn how to configure a project from scratch, both in React and Node. This includes setting up all the environment necessary to run the tools that I mentioned below.

In React, I will build a project containing all the most popular tools in project nowadays (08/2022), including: 
  <ul>
    <li>Typescript</li>
    <li>Axios</li>
    <li>React router dom</li>
    <li>Jest</li>
    <li>Testing library</li>
    <li>WebSocket</li>   
  </ul>
  
Besides those pure codding tools, I'm going to implement deploy environments.

I'm intended to do all the front-end development using TDD. As I'm not used to do It, probably I will not be able to do EVERYTHING with this pattern. But I will try my best.

Well, all set, enjoy!
