# jwt-login-screen

This is a project to simulate an basic authentication using nodeJS with JWT on backend and React in front.

More than pratice the auth using JWT, I want to use this project to learn how to configure a project from scratch.
In React, I will build a very common environment on the most of project nowadays (08/2022), including some tools: 
  <ul>
    <li>Typescript</li>
    <li>Axios</li>
    <li>React router dom</li>
    <li>Jest</li>
    <li>Testing library</li>
    <li>WebSocket</li>   
  </ul>
  
Besides those pure codding tools, I'm going to implement deploys environments, simulating CI/CD.

I'm intended to do all the front-end development using TDD. As I'm not used to do It, probably I will not be able to do EVERYTHING
with this pattern. But I will try my best.
